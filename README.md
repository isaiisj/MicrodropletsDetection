<h1>MicrodropletsDetection</h1>
This is our thesis topic about Cuantification of viral charge (SARS-Cov2) on microdroplets using OpenCV and Image processing techniques with python programming language by Isai Sanchez and Zuleima Hidalgo 
<h2>Abstract</h2>
The techniques for counting por PCR viral detection are advancing,
one way to do it is through microdroplets counting wich can be manually and 
a hard task and the other way is using the technology, computer vision and Machine Learning
to count and obtain information to process and analyze images.
